The term **project management** is used by many people in totally different ways.
It became anoying to me trying things out or reading articles in the web that have different baselines.

On the one hand it is fancy to do everything the agile way, especially in the domain of software projects. So should we stop thinking about classic management rules? In that case a project manager would ignore important phases or processes where an agile appoach has no answer for. 

On the other hand there is the classic project management. The Project Management Institute or [PMI](https://www.pmi.org/) is the biggest organization of its kind and created a 'standard' in a certain way. The PMI defines and describes every tiny detail you could ever imagine. So I decided to dive into the Project Management Body of Knowledge alias [PMBOKÂ®](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards). Of course there are also other paradigms, but I have choosen that one - get over it! <i class="mdi mdi-emoticon-outline" style="font-size: inherit"></i>
