Welcome!

Greetings from my fresh new web-page | blog | open source jekyll CMS.
I was fooling around for months with CMS systems and jekyll templates - most of them were horrible.

So recently, I decided to drive my web-page with Jekyll and host it on GitHub, because I have several semi-privates projects there anyway.
My personal webpages from the past were mostly one thing: static. So maybe this generation will become more interessting. The scope of this blog is about my professional job as software developer and project manager and maybe some parts of my private life.

You can find the source code of this page on GitHub under [Sin-Net/Pages](https://github.com/sin-net/Pages) for more information.
