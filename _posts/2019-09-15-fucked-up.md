Since 2008 I work in serious and professional IT-projects. Back in my early days I had some bad programming habbits for sure.
But luckily I learned alot in the past years **- and I`m still learning -**
and nowadays I follow some valuable agile methods and [DevOps](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/) ideals.
This post is about some general project management and coding behavior that will help your project not becoming a "fucked-up-story".

##### Brief Theory Background

##### The Project Setup

<div class="row">

     <img alt="attention" class="z-depth-3 materialboxed" data-caption="All images are from Pixabay"

  </div>
  <div class="col s12 m12 l7">
    Imagine the following situation: A customer pays over 100.000 EUR for a software, now this particular application is far beyond simplicity. I assume that it happens quite regularly that all the features are only roughly planned beforehand for those kind of project volumes. So was this one, because only the core features are clear ... somehow.
    <i class="mdi mdi-emoticon-poop" style="font-size: inherit"></i>
    <br /><br />
    The team contained of three major developers: one software architect, one frontend developer and a specialist for infrastructure implementations. The entire GUI and the behavior of the tool at runtime is more or less up to the team during the development process. Two third of the developers didn`t knew about (or ignored) agile development methods and the crutial safety net called UnitTests.
    <br /><br />
    All members had several years of experience and had successful projects in the past.
    But the outlined conditions turned into a fucked-up-story like from a textbook, but why?

##### Common Reasons for Failing

###### #1 Reason: Poor Communication

The team was very engaged at the beginning, specified a lot, discussed design decisions and so on.
But they had <span class="attention">neither a defined communication nor a way to safe their decisions</span>.
As the project made progress, the communication went down, decision were made without clearance and had to be rolled back afterwards.
These situations caused damage on the motivation and the acceptance of open discussions.

> Regular meetings like in Scrum or a kanban-like board would have saved the team to keep track on ongoing tasks.
> I would recommend internal and short meetings on a weekly basis plus a digital <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/product/issueboard/" target="_blank">project board</a> like GitLab supports it. 

###### #2 Reason: Ingnore UnitTests

As I told you, two third of the team didn`t wrote UnitTests themselves to test their developments or to secure their code against negative side effects when things change. But one third of the team did, guess who! <i class="mdi mdi-emoticon-wink-outline" style="font-size: inherit"></i> The result was a code base with only the most crutial tests, but even those were ignored, when they failed. Instead of fixing the tests, only the productive code was debugged, so the confusion got perfect. 

<blockquote>
UnitTests have some important benefits:
    <ul class="ul-md">
        <li>You test your covered code against errors, for sure, but <b> in parallel</b>.</li>
        <li>Isolated UnitTests make you to create a highliy modular and easy testable software architecture.</li>
        <li>UnitTests show the intented behavior of your code to your team members.</li>
        <li>The implementation of your code in a productive system gets straigt forward, when you have a UnitTest as a blue print.</li>
        <li>They prevent your productive code from getting polluted with "tests".</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>
