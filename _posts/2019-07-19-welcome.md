Greetings from my fresh new web page, blog, open source jekyll-based CMS. I was fooling around for months with CMS systems and Jekyll templates - most of them were horrible.

So recently, I decided to drive my web page with Jekyll, hosted on GitHub, because I have several semi-private projects there anyway.
My personal web pages from the past were mostly one thing: **static**. So maybe this generation will become more interesting.
The scope is about my professional job as software developer, project manager and some parts of my private life.

        Here you want to inform about a cool german blog that my wife is running: <a target="_blank" href="https://hejjuli.de/">Hej Juli</a> (formerly known as julinaeht).
        She maintains everything on her own, even tough she had no experiences on programming or similar things.
        Anyway, I found that wordpress or other CMS are quite hard to learn so I decided the nerdy way of blogging. :grin:
