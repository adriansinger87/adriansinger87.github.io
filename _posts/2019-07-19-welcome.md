Greetings from my fresh new web page, blog, open source jekyll-based CMS. I was fooling around for months with CMS systems* and Jekyll templates - most of them were horrible.

So recently, I decided to drive my web page with Jekyll, hosted on GitHub, because I have several semi-private projects there anyway.
My personal web pages from the past were mostly one thing: **static**. So maybe this generation will become more interesting.
The scope is about my professional job as software developer, project manager and some parts of my private life.

        * Here you should know that my girlfriend runs a cool german blog since years, named <a target="_blank" href="https://www.julinaeht.de/">julinaeht</a>.
        She maintains everything on her own, even tough she had no experiences on programming or similar things.
        Anyway, I found thst wordpress or other CMS are too hard to learn so here we are on a nerdy way of blogging.
